##A simple Perceptron Learning Algorithm example.
###The file target.py generates n random points, where n is the user input.
###The file pla.py uses the PLA to determine a hypothesis.
-Run as 
```
-$ python pla.py
```
-The graph shows target function in yellow and the hypothesis in blue  
-Notice how close both get as the number of points increase  
-100pts.png shows the same for 100 points as input

###Uses Python 2.7 with numpy, matplotlib
